To install the package, you will need a recent Squeak. I have been
using the 6.1-alpha trunk series: that is, the bleeding edge.

### Quickstart

### Detailed instructions

#### Download Squeak

Download
[a recent 6.1-alpha trunk image and VM](https://files.squeak.org/6.1alpha/Squeak6.1alpha-23331-64bit/)
for your platform.

#### Update Squeak

Update your image. Execute the following in a workspace:

```smalltalk
MCMcmUpdater updateFromServer
```

Alternatively, click the Squeak icon in the top left of the window,
and choose "Update Squeak":

![Squeak update menu item](<img/squeak-update.png>)

As of this writing, my updated image is at update number {{ site.squeak_updatenumber }}. This
includes all the `Kernel` changes necessary for supporting the
`Actors` package.

#### Install the Actors package

Execute the following in a workspace

```smalltalk
(Installer squeaksource project: 'Actors') install: 'ConfigurationOfActors'
```

Generally, the `ConfigurationOfActors` package is the latest release
of the package. After it has been loaded, you can optionally update to
the latest development version with

```smalltalk
"Optional step: update to the latest development version."
(Installer squeaksource project: 'Actors') install: 'Actors'
```
